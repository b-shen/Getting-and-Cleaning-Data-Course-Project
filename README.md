## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Author: Billy Shen

## Objectives

1. a tidy data set of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set ("UCI HAR Dataset") from UCI Machine Learning Repository
2. a link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
4. the analysis R script called 'run_analysis.R'

## This repo includes the following files:

- 'README.md': this file you are reading

- 'CodeBook.md': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'run_analysis.R': script for performing the data clean up of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

- 'tidydata.txt': clean tidy data set with the average of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each activity and each subject.
